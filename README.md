# My Challenge: Third Party API: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Develop a straightforward calendar app enabling users to record events for each working hour from 9 AM to 5 PM, by adjusting provided initial code. This application will operate within a web browser, utilizing jQuery to dynamically refresh its HTML and CSS content.

- My motivation: Understand how Third Party API works
- Why I took this challege: To solidify my understanding on JQuery, Bootstrap, and Dayjs.
- What the challenge solved: This calendar app has the ability to change the color of each time block depededing on the current hours. In addition, the user can save his/her input in local storage that persist even when the page is refreshed.
